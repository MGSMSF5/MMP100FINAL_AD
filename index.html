<div id="paragraph">
<p>I have always had a passion for video editing and graphic design. Im a bit weird, im always looking forward to the failure because it drives me to be better. There is so much beauty in failure. It keeps you "hungry", always looking for how to be better, smarter and faster. I embrace failures because they make my victory that much better.</p>
	
<p>As I began learning how to video edit and understand the process of graphic design, I have stumbled and fell to frustration. But the end product of my work is worth it. It may not be much to look at or anything to write home about but im much more fasinated by the process rather than the product. This is my second love.</p></div>
