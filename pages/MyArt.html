<div id="Paragraph">
<p>I am a pre-school teacher. The inspiration for this came from one of my children, nathan, who would always run away from me while going to the park for play time. I always told him that one day we would run far enough that he would forget how to get back to me and his friends.</p>

<p>One day, nathan was out with his family. His mom, Megan, his dad, Brock and his two older brothers Tyler and Sam. They all went to the mall one day and he decided to run off when we saw the toy store. He ran to the window to see the toys and when he turned back he realized his family was gone. His parents knew he had run off and decided to hide and see what he would do. Nathan cried and sat in a corner, he was scared. After some time passed his parents and brothers revealed themselves and nathan jumped for joy at the sight of his loved ones.</p>
	
<p>This story was told to me by his parents. Nathan came to school the next day and told me as well. I decided to make a lesson of this event to teach the children about safety and listening to directions. I created this little video using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to help make it interesting for my lesson. Since then nathan, nor any of my other children, have run off.</p>
